# The Hackers at Cambridge (HaC) Code of Conduct

The HaC Code of Conduct is the code of conduct that applies to all attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff at HaC events. All persons at a HaC event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout all HaC events. We expect cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe environment for everybody. Furthermore, HaC members are required to abide by the code of conduct at all times.

## The quick version

---

HaC is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of the following:

- gender
- gender identity and expression
- age
- sexual orientation
- disability
- physical appearance
- body size
- race
- ethnicity
- nationality
- religion
- previous hackathon attendance or lack of
- computing experience or lack of
- chosen programming language or tech stack

---

We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any HaC venue, this includes the following:

- hacks
- talks, presentations, or demos
- workshops
- any parties associated with HaC
- committee meetings
- any other events
- social media
- any other online media

---

Event participants or HaC violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from a HaC event or membership of HaC without a refund (if applicable) at the discretion of the event organisers and/or the HaC committee.

## The less quick version

---

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

---

Photography is encouraged at HaC events, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy.

---

Individuals asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

---

As hackathons are often organised, we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our events are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.

---

Sponsors, partners and organisers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

---

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an event organiser, staff or a [HaC committee member](/committee/committee.yaml) immediately.

---

Event organisers will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of any events. We value your attendance.

---

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes warning the offender, expulsion from the event with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.

---

We expect participants to follow these rules at events and workshop venues and HaC-related social events.
