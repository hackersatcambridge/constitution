# Constitution

The governing rules of "Hackers at Cambridge", hereafter (and in the rest of the repository) referred to as the "Society".

[Read the constitution here](constitution.md). You can also find a web version
[on our website](https://hackersatcambridge.com/constitution).

# This Repository

As laid out in the [constitution](constitution.md#society-repository), this repository is used to list all rules and guidelines of the Society that are not defined or contained in the constitution. This repository exists for the benefit of the executive committee, but is free to read for the general public for those who may be interested.

# Our Website

The official website of the Society is located at [https://hackersatcambridge.com](https://hackersatcambridge.com).

# Making changes to this repository

Any changes to this repository must require a majority vote at a meeting of the Executive Committee. Please view [the template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) for more information.

Relaxed restrictions can be specified for individual files or folders. All pull requests must adhere to all restrictions imposed by each file or folder it affects.

Any changes to the constitutional document must themselves meet constitutional requirements. In cases where this repository contradicts the constitution, the constitution always takes precedence.

In other cases, where files in this repository are used as the canonical source of information that has its own limitations on being changed, the requirements for changing that information *must* also be met. (eg. pull requests which change the document listing the executive committee must list how the changes were voted on, and meet the requirements laid out in the constitution, similarly for the membership list.)

# Membership

Any changes to this file must satisfy the requirements laid out in the constitution for adding or removing members for the Society.

# Executive Committee

The canonical list of members of the executive is the [committee/committee.yaml](committee/committee.yaml) file. Any changes to this file must satisfy the requirements laid out in the constitution for adding or removing members for the Executive Committee.
