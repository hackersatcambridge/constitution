# Constitution

The governing rules of "Hackers at Cambridge", hereafter referred to as the "Society".

[Read the constitution here](constitution.md). You can also find a web version
[on our website](https://hackersatcambridge.com/constitution).

# This Repository

As laid out in the [constitution](constitution.md#society-repository), this repository is used to list all rules and guidelines of the Society that are not defined or contained in the constitution. This repository exists for the benefit of the executive committee, but is free to read for the general public for those who may be interested.

As for why we went with this setup, we will be posting more information about this soon!

# Our Website

The official website of the Society is located at [https://hackersatcambridge.com](https://hackersatcambridge.com).

# Making changes to this repository

Any changes to this repository must require a majority vote at a meeting of the Executive Committee may issue a change to the Repository's documents. Please view [the template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) for more information. Individual files or folders may relax these requirements when changes are made to them, but these requirements are *only* relaxed for those changes which affect those files and folders.

However, if changes to this repository affect the constitution document on this repository in *any* way, the requirements for changes to the constitution as outlined within it *must* be met. In cases where this repository contradicts the constitution, the constitution always takes precedence.

In other cases, where files in this repository are used as the canonical source of information that has its own limitations on being changed, the requirements for changing that information *must* also be met. (eg. pull requests which change the document listing the executive committee must give list how the changes were voted on, and meet the requirements laid out in the constitution, similarly for the membership list.)

# Membership

Membership of the Society is determined as outlined in the [constitution](constitution.md), the canonical list of members is the [members/members.yaml](members/members.yaml) file. Any changes to this file must satisfy the requirements laid out in the constitution for adding or removing members for the Society.

# Executive Committee

The canonical list of members of the executive is the [committee/committee.yaml](committee/committee.yaml) file. Any changes to this file must satisfy the requirements laid out in the constitution for adding or removing members for the Society.
