The aim of `EVENT_NAME` is to create a fun, exciting, original game from scratch in less than `EVENT_LENGTH` hours. We've created a few simple rules to help the process go smoothly for everyone.

- Please respect and look after `VENUE_NAME`. Note that no food or drinks are permitted in `ROOMS_WHERE_FOOD_OR_DRINK_NOT_PERMITTED`, and we will be checking!

- You can work on your game in a team of up to four people.

- Game-making commences at `START_TIME` and finishes at `END_TME`.

- You are free to do whatever you like with your game after `EVENT_NAME`. You own the copyright to all the material you create during `EVENT_NAME`.

- You are free to use any tools or libraries available to you to create your game. You can start with any pre-existing code or content that you like and you are free to use third-party assets, as long as you let the judges know what you created yourself and what you didn't. Failure to do so could risk disqualification.

- It's your responsibility to make sure that you have the right to use third-party assets (for example, that they are public domain or available under an appropriate license).

- We will be taking lots of photos throughout the event, and publishing them. You and your content may appear on some of these photos. We aim to publish photos that show everyone at their best, but there might be a few that you donâ€™t like. If you see a photo like this, let us know so that we can try to take it down - but be aware that it is difficult to completely erase a photo from all media channels.

- Be kind and considerate to your fellow hackers and our volunteers. We're all here to have fun! By participating in the hackathon, you agree to abide by this [Code of Conduct](https://hackcodeofconduct.org/).
