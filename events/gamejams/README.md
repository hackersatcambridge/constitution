# Game Jams

This folder contains information and resources for when the Society decides to host game jams - which are essentially game-themed hackathons.

As game jams are a type of hackathon, the code of conduct that applies to the Society's hackathons applies to game jams as well.

The [rules.md](rules.md) contains a model set of rules that can be used in the running of a game jam. However, the organiser of any of the Society's game jams may modify them as they see fit - for the benefit of the particular event that they are running.
