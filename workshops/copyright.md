# Preamble

We ideally want to attract the best presenters possible, giving them a great opportunity to educate people on something that excites them. To help with this, we want them to feel empowered and have ownership of the content they create. However, we also want all our workshop material to be reusable in the future - so in that sense they should be open source.

# Rules on workshop copyright

Individuals wishing to create content for workshops on behalf of HaC must agree to the following rules.

## Material ownership

Individuals contributing material to a workshop may choose to retain ownership over any content they create, provided that they release such content under a suitable license as described below. However, individuals may also transfer copyright ownership of the content they create to HaC at their own discretion of they so choose.

## Material licensing

Any material that is created for a workshop is recommended to be published under one of the following open-source licenses:

- [MIT](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html)

- [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

- [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

- [Public Domain](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Public_domain) or [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/)

However, with the approval of two committee members (excluding the presenter), work may be published under any of the open-source licenses listed at [https://spdx.org/licenses/](https://spdx.org/licenses/). However, this should be done for a justified reason, such as a workshop building on any material published under another open-source license.

HaC reserves the right to deny the usage of any material in a workshop that is not subject to an approved license.

## Where to put the LICENSE?

The document named `LICENSE`, containing a full description of the license of the workshop, must be put in the root folder of any workshop repository. Although the workshop itself may contain metadata identifying a license used for the workshop, this must be in addition to, and not instead of a `LICENSE` document. Furthermore, in cases where metadata and a `LICENSE` document contradict each other, the `LICENSE` document shall be considered the license under which material is published.
